Introductory Level Work-In-Progress Event Planning Website Utilizing JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, JQuery, and IndexedDB

**Intentions**
As event planning is one of my greatest most challenging pleasures, I wanted to create a website which helps hosts of all different times. Eventually, I will work around to an account, but for now I just use indexedDB to store user information within an internet browser. 

**Currently working on**

1. displaying user information
2. editing database after initially created
